•	keywords (e.g. if, else, while, echo, etc.), classes, functions, and user-defined functions are not case-sensitive.
•	However; all variable names are case-sensitive! ($color, $CoLOr, $COLOR all are different)
•	PHP echo statement is often used to output data to the screen. The following example will show how to output text and a variable:
Example 1
<?php
$txt = "Schools ";
echo "I love $txt!";
?>
The following example will produce the same output as the example above:
Example 2
<?php
$txt = "Schools ";
echo "I love " . $txt . "!";
?>
Example3
<?php
$x = 5;
$y = 4;
echo $x + $y;
?>
Global and Local Scope - A variable declared outside a function has a GLOBAL SCOPE and can only be accessed outside a function:
Example - Variable with global scope:
<?php
$x = 5; // global scope
function myTest() {
  // using x inside this function will generate an error
  echo "<p>Variable x inside function is: $x</p>";
}
myTest();
echo "<p>Variable x outside function is: $x</p>";
?>
Example
<?php
$x = 5;
$y = 10; 
function myTest() {
  global $x, $y;
  $y = $x + $y;
}
myTest();
echo $y; // outputs 15
?>

•	A variable declared within a function has a LOCAL SCOPE and can only be accessed within that function:
Example - Variable with local scope:
<?php
function myTest() {
  $x = 5; // local scope
  echo "<p>Variable x inside function is: $x</p>";
}
myTest();
// using x outside the function will generate an error
echo "<p>Variable x outside function is: $x</p>";
?>
•	You can have local variables with the same name in different functions, because local variables are only recognized by the function in which they are declared.
The static Keyword
Normally, when a function is completed/executed, all of its variables are deleted. However, sometimes we want a local variable NOT to be deleted. We need it for a further job.
To do this, use the static keyword when you first declare the variable:
Example
<?php
function myTest() {
  static $x = 0;
  echo $x;
  $x++;
}
myTest();
myTest();
myTest();
?>
•	ECHO AND PRINT are more or less the same. They are both used to output data to the screen.
The differences are small: echo has no return value while print has a return value of 1 so it can be used in expressions. echo can take multiple parameters (although such usage is rare) while print can take one argument. echo is marginally faster than print.
•	
•	PHP var_dump() function returns the data type and value:
Example
<?php
$x = 5985;
var_dump($x);
?>

PHP supports the following data types:
•	String
•	Integer
•	Float (floating point numbers - also called double)
•	Boolean
•	Array
•	Object
•	NULL
•	
	strlen() - Return the Length of a String
The PHP strlen() function returns the length of a string.
Example
Return the length of the string "Hello world!":
<?php
echo strlen("Hello world!"); // outputs 12
?>

	str_word_count() - Count Words in a String
The PHP str_word_count() function counts the number of words in a string.
Example
Count the number of word in the string "Hello world!":
<?php
echo str_word_count("Hello world!"); // outputs 2
?>

	strrev() - Reverse a String
The PHP strrev() function reverses a string.
Example
Reverse the string "Hello world!":
<?php
echo strrev("Hello world!"); // outputs !dlrow olleH
?>
	strpos() - Search For a Text Within a String
The PHP strpos() function searches for a specific text within a string. If a match is found, the function returns the character position of the first match. If no match is found, it will return FALSE.
Example
Search for the text "world" in the string "Hello world!":
<?php
echo strpos("Hello world!", "world"); // outputs 6
?>
	str_replace() - Replace Text Within a String
str_replace() function replaces some characters with some other characters in a string.
Example
Replace the text "world" with "Dolly":
<?php
echo str_replace("world", "Dolly", "Hello world!"); // outputs Hello Dolly!
?>

	PHP has the following functions to check if the type of a variable is integer:
•	is_int()
•	is_integer() - alias of is_int()
•	is_long() - alias of is_int()
Example
Check if the type of a variable is integer:
<?php
$x = 5985;
var_dump(is_int($x));

$x = 59.85;
var_dump(is_int($x));
?>

	PHP has the following functions to check if the type of a variable is float:
•	is_float()
•	is_double() - alias of is_float()
Example
Check if the type of a variable is float:
<?php
$x = 10.365;
var_dump(is_float($x));
?>

The pi() function returns the value of PI:
Example
<?php
echo(pi()); // returns 3.1415926535898
?>
	PHP min() and max() Functions
The min() and max() functions can be used to find the lowest or highest value in a list of arguments:
Example
<?php
echo(min(0, 150, 30, 20, -8, -200));  // returns -200
echo(max(0, 150, 30, 20, -8, -200));  // returns 150
?>________________________________________
	PHP abs() Function
The abs() function returns the absolute (positive) value of a number:
Example
<?php
echo(abs(-6.7));  // returns 6.7
?>

	PHP sqrt() Function
The sqrt() function returns the square root of a number:
Example
<?php
echo(sqrt(64));  // returns 8
?>

	PHP round() Function
The round() function rounds a floating-point number to its nearest integer:
Example
<?php
echo(round(0.60));  // returns 1
echo(round(0.49));  // returns 0
?>

	Random Numbers
The rand() function generates a random number:
Example
<?php
echo(rand());
?>

To get more control over the random number, you can add the optional min and max parameters to specify the lowest integer and the highest integer to be returned.
For example, if you want a random integer between 10 and 100 (inclusive), use rand(10, 100):
Example
<?php
echo(rand(10, 100));
?>


	PHP Casting Strings and Floats to Integers
Sometimes you need to cast a numerical value into another data type.
The (int), (integer), or intval() function are often used to convert a value to an integer.
Example
Cast float and string to integer:
<?php
// Cast float to int
$x = 23465.768;
$int_cast = (int)$x;
echo $int_cast;

echo "<br>";

// Cast string to int
$x = "23465.768";
$int_cast = (int)$x;
echo $int_cast;
?>

	Create a PHP Constant
To create a constant, use the define() function.
Syntax
define(name, value, case-insensitive)
Parameters:
•	name: Specifies the name of the constant
•	value: Specifies the value of the constant
•	case-insensitive: Specifies whether the constant name should be case-insensitive. Default is false
Example
Create a constant with a case-sensitive name:
<?php
define("GREETING", "Welcome to W3Schools.com!");
echo GREETING;
?>
Example
Create a constant with a case-insensitive name:
<?php
define("GREETING", "Welcome to W3Schools.com!", true);
echo greeting;
?>

	PHP Constant Arrays
In PHP7, you can create an Array constant using the define() function.
Example
Create an Array constant:
<?php
define("cars", [
  "Alfa Romeo",
  "BMW",
  "Toyota"
]);
echo cars[0];
?> output – Alfa Romeo________________________________________
	Constants are Global
Constants are automatically global and can be used across the entire script.
Example
This example uses a constant inside a function, even if it is defined outside the function:
<?php
define("GREETING", "Welcome to school!");
function myTest() {
  echo GREETING;
}
myTest();
?>  //Output Welcome to school!


%	Modulus	$x % $y	Remainder of $x divided by $y	Try it »

**	Exponentiation	$x ** $y	Result of raising $x to the $y'th power	

x %= y	x = x % y	Modulus
==	Equal	$x == $y	Returns true if $x is equal to $y	Try it »

===	Identical	$x === $y	Returns true if $x is equal to $y, and they are of the same type	
<>	Not equal	$x <> $y	Returns true if $x is not equal to $y	Try it »

!==	Not identical	$x !== $y	Returns true if $x is not equal to $y, or they are not of the same type	
.	Concatenation	$txt1 . $txt2	Concatenation of $txt1 and $txt2
PHP Conditional Assignment Operators
The PHP conditional assignment operators are used to set a value depending on conditions:
?:	Ternary	$x = expr1 ? expr2 : expr3	Returns the value of $x.
The value of $x is expr2 if expr1 = TRUE.
The value of $x is expr3 if expr1 = FALSE	Try it »

??	Null coalescing	$x = expr1 ?? expr2	Returns the value of $x.  The value of $x is expr1 if expr1 exists, and is not NULL.
If expr1 does not exist, or is NULL, the value of $x is expr2.

	PHP - The if...elseif...else Statement
The if...elseif...else statement executes different codes for more than two conditions.
Syntax
if (condition) {
  code to be executed if this condition is true;
} elseif (condition) {
  code to be executed if first condition is false and this condition is true;
} else {
  code to be executed if all conditions are false;
}
Example
Output "Have a good morning!" if the current time is less than 10, and "Have a good day!" if the current time is less than 20. Otherwise it will output "Have a good night!":
<?php
$t = date("H");
if ($t < "10") {
  echo "Have a good morning!";
} elseif ($t < "20") {
  echo "Have a good day!";
} else {
  echo "Have a good night!";
}
?>

	The PHP switch Statement
Use the switch statement to select one of many blocks of code to be executed.
Syntax
switch (n) {
  case label1:
    code to be executed if n=label1;
    break;
  case label2:
    code to be executed if n=label2;
    break;
  case label3:
    code to be executed if n=label3;
    break;
    ...
  default:
    code to be executed if n is different from all labels;
}
This is how it works: First we have a single expression n (most often a variable), that is evaluated once. The value of the expression is then compared with the values for each case in the structure. If there is a match, the block of code associated with that case is executed. Use break to prevent the code from running into the next case automatically. The default statement is used if no match is found.
Example
<?php
$favcolor = "red";
switch ($favcolor) {
  case "red":
    echo "Your favorite color is red!";
    break;
  case "blue":
    echo "Your favorite color is blue!";
    break;
  case "green":
    echo "Your favorite color is green!";
    break;
  default:
    echo "Your favorite color is neither red, blue, nor green!";
}
?>

In PHP, we have the following loop types:
•	while - loops through a block of code as long as the specified condition is true
•	do...while - loops through a block of code once, and then repeats the loop as long as the specified condition is true
•	for - loops through a block of code a specified number of times
•	foreach - loops through a block of code for each element in an array
	while Loop and Do While Loop
The while loop executes a block of code as long as the specified condition is true.
Syntax
while (condition is true) {
  code to be executed;
}
Examples
The example below displays the numbers from 1 to 5:
Example
<?php
$x = 1;

while($x <= 5) {
  echo "The number is: $x <br>";
  $x++;
}
?>

	do...while 
loop will always execute the block of code once, it will then check the condition, and repeat the loop while the specified condition is true.
Syntax
do {
  code to be executed;
} while (condition is true);
Examples
The example below first sets a variable $x to 1 ($x = 1). Then, the do while loop will write some output, and then increment the variable $x with 1. Then the condition is checked (is $x less than, or equal to 5?), and the loop will continue to run as long as $x is less than, or equal to 5:
Example
<?php
$x = 1;

do {
  echo "The number is: $x <br>";
  $x++;
} while ($x <= 5);
?>
Note: In a do...while loop the condition is tested AFTER executing the statements within the loop. This means that the do...while loop will execute its statements at least once, even if the condition is false

	For Loop
The for loop is used when you know in advance how many times the script should run.
Syntax
for (init counter; test counter; increment counter) {
  code to be executed for each iteration;
}
Parameters:
•	init counter: Initialize the loop counter value
•	test counter: Evaluated for each loop iteration. If it evaluates to TRUE, the loop continues. If it evaluates to FALSE, the loop ends.
•	increment counter: Increases the loop counter value
Examples
The example below displays the numbers from 0 to 10:
Example
<?php
for ($x = 0; $x <= 10; $x++) {
  echo "The number is: $x <br>";
}
?>
	The PHP foreach Loop
The foreach loop works only on arrays, and is used to loop through each key/value pair in an array.
Syntax
foreach ($array as $value) {
  code to be executed;
}
For every loop iteration, the value of the current array element is assigned to $value and the array pointer is moved by one, until it reaches the last array element.
Examples
The following example will output the values of the given array ($colors):
Example
<?php
$colors = array("red", "green", "blue", "yellow");

foreach ($colors as $value) {
  echo "$value <br>";
}
?>

The following example will output both the keys and the values of the given array ($age):
Example
<?php
$age = array("Peter"=>"35", "Ben"=>"37", "Joe"=>"43");

foreach($age as $x => $val) {
  echo "$x = $val<br>";
}
?>
	PHP Break
You have already seen the break statement used in an earlier chapter of this tutorial. It was used to "jump out" of a switch statement.
The break statement can also be used to jump out of a loop.
This example jumps out of the loop when x is equal to 4:
Example
<?php
for ($x = 0; $x < 10; $x++) {
  if ($x == 4) {
    break;
  }
  echo "The number is: $x <br>";
}
?>

	PHP Continue
The continue statement breaks one iteration (in the loop), if a specified condition occurs, and continues with the next iteration in the loop.
This example skips the value of 4:
Example
<?php
for ($x = 0; $x < 10; $x++) {
  if ($x == 4) {
    continue;
  }
  echo "The number is: $x <br>";
}
?>

	Break and Continue in While Loop
You can also use break and continue in while loops:
Break Example
<?php
$x = 0;

while($x < 10) {
  if ($x == 4) {
    break;
  }
  echo "The number is: $x <br>";
  $x++;
}
?>
Continue Example
<?php
$x = 0;

while($x < 10) {
  if ($x == 4) {
    $x++;
    continue;
  }
  echo "The number is: $x <br>";
  $x++;
}
?>

PHP User Defined Functions
Besides the built-in PHP functions, it is possible to create your own functions.
•	A function is a block of statements that can be used repeatedly in a program.
•	A function will not execute automatically when a page loads.
•	A function will be executed by a call to the function.
Syntax
function functionName() {
  code to be executed;
}
•	Note: A function name must start with a letter or an underscore. Function names are NOT case-sensitive.
Example
<?php
function familyName($fname) {
  echo "$fname Refsnes.<br>";
}
familyName("Jani");
familyName("Hege");
familyName("Stale");
familyName("Kai Jim");
familyName("Borge");
?>
Example
<?php
function familyName($fname, $year) {
  echo "$fname Refsnes. Born in $year <br>";
}
familyName("Hege", "1975");
familyName("Stale", "1978");
familyName("Kai Jim", "1983");
?>
Example
<?php declare(strict_types=1); // strict requirement
function sum(int $x, int $y) {
  $z = $x + $y;
  return $z;
}

echo "5 + 10 = " . sum(5, 10) . "<br>";
echo "7 + 13 = " . sum(7, 13) . "<br>";
echo "2 + 4 = " . sum(2, 4);
?>
Example
Use a pass-by-reference argument to update a variable:
<?php
function add_five(&$value) {
  $value += 5;
}

$num = 2;
add_five($num);
echo $num;
?>
Example
<?php declare(strict_types=1); // strict requirement
function addNumbers(float $a, float $b) : float {
  return $a + $b;
}
echo addNumbers(1.2, 5.2);
?>
You can specify a different return type, than the argument types, but make sure the return is the correct type:
Example
<?php declare(strict_types=1); // strict requirement
function addNumbers(float $a, float $b) : int {
  return (int)($a + $b);
}
echo addNumbers(1.2, 5.2);
?>

What is an Array?
An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time.
If you have a list of items (a list of car names, for example), storing the cars in single variables could look like this:
$cars1 = "Volvo";
$cars2 = "BMW";
$cars3 = "Toyota";
However, what if you want to loop through the cars and find a specific one? And what if you had not 3 cars, but 300?
The solution is to create an array!
An array can hold many values under a single name, and you can access the values by referring to an index number.
________________________________________
Create an Array in PHP
In PHP, the array() function is used to create an array:
array();
In PHP, there are three types of arrays:
•	Indexed arrays - Arrays with a numeric index
•	Associative arrays - Arrays with named keys
•	Multidimensional arrays - Arrays containing one or more arrays
count() function is used to return the length (the number of elements) of an array:
Example
<?php
$cars = array("Volvo", "BMW", "Toyota");
echo count($cars);
?>
